## Time and place

Tuesdays and Thursdays 9:30-10:50. WPHB30 

## Contact

| office: 224 STO | email: abacon@usc.edu | in person office hours: Thursday 2-3pm (by appointment) | [zoom](https://usc.zoom.us/s/3587631632) office hours: Wednesday 9-10 (by appointment) |

## Texts


Material will be drawn primarily from lectures and notes. The two books listed below are useful supplements. It is recommended that you take handwritten notes during class, so you will need a notepad. This can be supplemented by the first few chapters of
- For the first part of the course on inductive structures:
	- Chapter two of *The Limits of Logic* by Jeff Russell (free, and available in the dropbox folder).
- Later portions of the course on propositional and modal logics:
	- chapters 1-3 of Ted Sider's *Logic for Philosophy*.

## Course description

In this course students will learn fundamental results in metalogic. The course begins with an introduction to mathematical reasoning about inductive structures, such as natural numbers, sequences, trees and sentences. Using these tools we will then study the model theory and proof theory for classical and non-classical propositional logics allowing us to establish various soundness, completeness, and indepedence results. If time permits we will look at propositional modal logic, and first-order and higher-order logics, 

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites.

## Grading



- Participation
	- Students are encouraged to ask questions or ask for clarification
    at any point.

- Grading
	- You will be assessed entirely on the basis of weekly exercises (20%), participation and in-class exercises (20%), two exams (30% and 30%).

- Weekly exercises 
	- These will be graded on a pass fail basis. Note that a pass does **not** mean that you got the exercise correct -- it means that you gave the exercise an honest try. Solutions to exercises will be covered in class. 
	- You have two free passes: you may miss up to two weekly exercises without it affecting your grade, which should be reserved for illness or family emergencies. Further absences will need proper documentation.
	- Feedback on solutions is always verbal. Make sure you prepare any questions you had for the in-class discussion of solutions, and come to office hours if necessary. 

- In-class exercises

	- You will present a solution to an exercise of your choice on the board. The signup sheet for these presentations can be found
    [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBS1wHt6BXQcAODjO8jnl23bCghvA7EsuUoMQ8klgAA/edit?usp=sharing).

- Midterm
	- Thursday, October 3rd. In class exam.

- Final
	- Thursday December 5th, in class.
	- Exams *cannot* be rescheduled except in a very limited set of circumstances (you may consult the universities regulations and policies [here]( http://catalogue.usc.edu/content.php?catoid=2&navoid=281) ).

## Statement on academic conduct and support services

### Academic Conduct

Plagiarism - presenting someone else's ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words - is a serious academic offense with serious consequences.
