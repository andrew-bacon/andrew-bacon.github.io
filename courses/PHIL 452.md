## Texts

Material will be drawn primarily from lectures. Notes that supplement the lectures can be found [here](https://modal-logic.gabrieluzquiano.org/).

It is recommended that you take handwritten notes during class, so you will need a notepad. The two books listed below also cover the same material and can provide further context. The second book is more advanced. 

- *A New Introduction to Modal Logic*. Hughes and Cresswell.
- *Modal Logic*. Blackburn, de Rijke and Venema.

NB: the first book uses the symbol *L* for $\Box$ and *M* for $\Diamond$.

## Course description

Modal logic is the study of the logical behaviour of modalities, often expressed by words like *necessarily* and *possibly*. Modal logic finds applications in all areas of philosophy: in metaphysics in the study of modality, time and laws; in the philosophy of language in the study of vagueness, conditionals and modals; in epistemology in the study of knowledge and belief, and in ethics in the form of deontic logic. Modalities of different sorts appear to be governed by a common logic, called **K**, and specific modalities may possibly be governed by further principles. In this course you will learn how to represent modalities in a formal system in which their logical properties can be formalized and studied. In the first part of the course we will look at how modalities interact with other logical words---the truth functional connectives and the quantifiers---and we will study their proof theory and model theory. In the second part of the course we will look at some philosophical applications of modal logics.


## Prerequisites

PHIL 350, PHIL 222. You should be familiar with propositional logic, and have experience with proofs by induction. We will recap these ideas in class. The prerequisites may be waived if the student can demonstrate some relevant background, which may include relevant courses in mathematics, linguistics or computer science. 

## Grading

- Participation: 20%
	- Contribute to class discussion. Be prepared to answer questions if called upon, and to raise your hand if you do not understand something. You are collectively responsible for setting the pace of the class, and clarificatory questions. 5\% 
	- You will present a solution to an exercise of your choice on the board. The signup sheet for these presentations can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DAJ2HGG18I3qAt6Rv3DHMP9vQDyHGQjuJmUtjGOOSg/edit?usp=sharing). Once you have signed up for an exercise please do not sign up again until everyone in the class has had a chance to present. 15%.

- Exercises 50\%
	
	- Weekly exercises will be graded on a pass fail basis, and must be submitted before we discuss them in class.
	- If you can provide a reason that you will not complete the exercises by the deadline, let me know *in advance*, and we can discuss an extension.
	
- Final Project: 5% + 25%
	- Proposal: 5%. Due April 9.
	
		Submit a detailed proposal of what you intend to do your final project on.

	- Final project: 25%. Due April 31.

## Statement on academic conduct and support services

### Academic Conduct

Plagiarism - presenting someone else's ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words - is a serious academic offense with serious consequences. Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11, Behavior Violating University Standards. Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus and university policies on scientific misconduct.
