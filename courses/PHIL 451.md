## Course description

Higher-order languages expand the language of first-order logic by allowing generalizations into grammatical positions other than that of singular terms. They have found numerous applications in philosophy, computer science, mathematics and linguistics. This course introduces students to higher-order languages, their proof and model theory, and their applications.


**Objectives**: In this course students will learn to be proficient with the $\lambda$ notation; to formulate ideas in higher-order languages and to reason from them; how to build theories stated in higher-order languages and to use models to probe their consequences; about the philosophical applications of higher-order languages.



## Prerequisites

PHIL 350, PHIL 222. The prerequisites may be waived if the student can demonstrate some relevant background, which may include relevant courses in mathematics, linguistics or computer science.

## Statement on academic conduct and support services

### Academic Conduct

Plagiarism - presenting someone else's ideas as your own, either verbatim or recast in your own words - is a serious academic offense with serious consequences.
