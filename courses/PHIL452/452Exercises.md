# PHIL 451: Exercises

## Exercises 1

Let $P$ be *God exists*. Consider the argument

1. $\Box (P \to \Box P)$ (Premise)

2. $\Diamond P$ (Premise)

3. $\Diamond \Box P$

4. $P$

Given the possible worlds semantics, does the step from 1 and 2 to 3 seem to be good? What about the step from 3 to 4? 

Draw a possible worlds diagram in which the inference fails: in which there is a world where 1 and 2 are true, and 4 is false.

## Exercise 2

1. Draw all the models over the frame $W={w,v}$, $R={(w,v)}$ in which every letter, except for $P$, is false. (There should be four.)

2. Prove that ${x \mid x\subseteq {1}} = {{}, {1}}$.

3. Suppose that we define $(a,b)$ as ${{a}, {a,b}}$. Prove that this definition satisfies the pairing principle: $(a,b)=(c,d)$ iff $a=c$ and $b=d$.

4. Draw a frame with at least three worlds, and at least three arrows. Represent it as a set $W$ and a relation $R$ using set theoretic notation.

5. Draw the frame with worlds $W={w, u, v}$ and accessibility relation $R={(w,u), (u,v), (v,v), (w,w)}$.
