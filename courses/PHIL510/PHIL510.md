# PHIL 510: Logic, Mathematics and Metaphysics

## Time and place

Wednesdays, 4:30-6:50. MHP 102.


## Contact

| Andrew Bacon | office: 224 STO | email: abacon@usc.edu | in person office hours by appointment | [zoom](https://usc.zoom.us/s/3587631632)  |

## Textbook

There is no specific textbook for the course, but here are some useful resources.

*From Frege to Godel*. van Heijenoort.

*From Kant to Hilbert* volume II. Ewald.

For technical background on higher-order and modal logic: 

*A Philosophical Introduction to Higher-order Logics*. Bacon.

*A New Introduction to Modal Logic*. Hughes and Cresswell.

Parts I and II of my book, and the first couple of chapters of the second will be more than enough for what we will need.

## Course description




Throughout its history logic has played a central role in foundational mathematics and in philosophy. In the higher-order logical framework of Frege's Begriffschrift and its descendents, the line between logic, metaphysics and mathematics is blurred. While these logical systems are neutral about mathematical ontology -- they do not imply the existence of abstract mathematical objects -- there are purely logical statements that constrain the behaviour of mathematical reality if there *were* mathematical objects. There are, for example, purely logical statements that would force the truth or falsity of contentious mathematical statments like the continuum hypothesis on the assumption that sets exist. Similarly, while these systems are neutral about the existence of abstract objects like properties, propositions, possible worlds, and the like, one can formulate purely logical statements that constraint the behaviour of these things if they *were* to exist. There are statements, for instance, that would force various claims about modal reality, about the structure of propositions, and so on, if they were to exist. 

In this course we will look at the interaction between logical hypotheses that have been traditionally associated with "mathematics", and hypotheses traditionally associated with "metaphysics" and will look at ways in which these two seemingly different disciplines have implications for each other. 

Questions we will consider will include: Could there have been more sets than there in fact are? Are the truths of mathematics necessary or contingent? What is the distinction between potential infinities and actual infinities? Can mathematics be reduced to pure logic? Can metaphysics be reduced to pure logic? Can metaphysical theses about the structure of propositions, about modal reality, and so on, imply or be implied by interesting mathematical claims?  


## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites.

## Classroom norms

Please come to class ready to learn, and prepared to engage in class discussions. Clarificatory questions are always appreciated, and can be helpful to your classmates. Be constructive in your interactions with other students, and try when possible to help each other out.

Laptops, phones and other distractions must be out of sight during class. I encourage students to take handwritten notes; if you have a special reason to use an electronic device contact me about it.



## Statement on academic conduct and support services

### Academic Conduct

The University of Southern California is foremost a learning community committed to fostering successful scholars and researchers dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and the transmission of ideas. Academic misconduct is in contrast to the university’s mission to educate students through a broad array of first-rank academic, professional, and extracurricular programs and includes any act of dishonesty in the submission of academic work (either in draft or final form).

This course will follow the expectations for academic integrity as stated in the USC Student Handbook. All students are expected to submit assignments that are original work and prepared specifically for the course/section in this academic term. You may not submit work written by others or “recycle” work prepared for other courses without obtaining written permission from the instructor(s). Students suspected of engaging in academic misconduct will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity.

Other violations of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabrication (e.g., falsifying data), knowingly assisting others in acts of academic dishonesty, and any act that gains or is intended to gain an unfair academic advantage.

The impact of academic dishonesty is far-reaching and is considered a serious offense against the university and could result in outcomes such as failure on the assignment, failure in the course, suspension, or even expulsion from the university.

For more information about academic integrity see the student handbook or the Office of Academic Integrity’s website, and university policies on Research and Scholarship Misconduct.
