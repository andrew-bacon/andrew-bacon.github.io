From Book I, read Definitions, Postulates and Common Notions, Propositions 1-3.

### Questions (Monday 15th January.)

Due 

Using the notions of congruence, betweenness and point, and the definition of a region as a collection of points, define the following notions.

1. The notion of a straight line (which could be infinite, finite, closed or open).

2. The notion of a straight line that is infinite in both directions.

3. xy is at least as long as zw.

4. In proposition 1 of the elements, Euclid constructs a pair of congruent circles each of whose center lies on the edge of the other. He then shows, from his basic postulates, that the the centers of these two circles, along with one of the points it which the circles intersects is an equilateral triangle (a triangle with equal sides). How does Euclid know that there is a point at which the circles intersect? Do you think this can be proven from his postulates?


### Questions (Friday 19th January)

Using the notions of congruence, betweenness and point, and the definition of a region as a collection of points, define the following notions.

1. Sphere.

2. A plane.

3. A circle.

4. Three points, xyz, forming a right angle (with y at the angle).

5. Parallel lines.
