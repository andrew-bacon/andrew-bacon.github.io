# PHIL 236

# Exercises and reading

## Topic 1

### Reading 

For Tuesday 15th January.

> Euclid's [Elements](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/books/Euclid/Elements.pdf) .

From Book I, read Definitions, Postulates and Common Notions, Propositions 1-3.

### Questions (Monday 15th January.)

Using the notions of congruence, betweenness and point, and the definition of a region as a collection of points, define the following notions.

1. The notion of a straight line (which could be infinite, finite, closed or open).

2. The notion of a straight line that is infinite in both directions.

3. xy is at least as long as zw.

4. In proposition 1 of the elements, Euclid constructs a pair of congruent circles each of whose center lies on the edge of the other. He then shows, from his basic postulates, that the the centers of these two circles, along with one of the points it which the circles intersects is an equilateral triangle (a triangle with equal sides). How does Euclid know that there is a point at which the circles intersect? Do you think this can be proven from his postulates?


### Questions (Friday 19th January)

Using the notions of congruence, betweenness and point, and the definition of a region as a collection of points, define the following notions.

1. Sphere.

2. A plane.

3. A circle.

4. Three points, xyz, forming a right angle (with y at the angle).

5. Parallel lines.

## Topic 2: Non-Euclidean Geometry (Due Monday 5th February)

### Exercises

1. Let us say that three balls in ordinary Euclidean space are "right angled" iff their centres are at right angles. Does this notion make sense in a (non-Euclidean) pointless geometry, where there are no points, and thus no centres? Justify your answer: you may freely use any notions we defined in class from ball and parthood.

2. In Euclidean geometry, do you think it is possible to define the relation of $x$ being 1 meter from $y$ using congruence and betweenness? Explain your answer either way.

3. Can you define the primitive of Kantian geometry --- $w$ is on the left of the plane defined by $xyz$ --- using only congruence and betweenness. Justify your answer.

## Topic 3: Mathematical representations of space

### Reading 

Watch [youtube video on Pythagoras' theorem](https://youtu.be/8vHO-tFx3K0?si=5efJiA-Nzy_mYh9-)

Chapter 1 of Maudlin. 


## Topic 4: Incongruent Counterparts

### Reading 

The papers by Kant and van Cleve in the dropbox folder.

### Exercises

1. Describe your own example of a pair of incongruent counterparts. (Formally, a counterpart is something that is related by a isometry: a mapping preserving congruence and betweenness. Congruent entities can be superimposed, so incongruent counterparts are two individuals that are related by an isometry but can't be superimposed.)

2. Could a hand in otherwise empty space be left or right in virtue of its relation to a Euclidean space? Explain your answer using the tests for definability we have studied in previous classes.
